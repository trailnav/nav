		<div>Route Description

This area has one of the world's greatest and best conserved concentrations of historic mine buildings and contains unusual wildlife, some of which only thrives in mining landscape habitats

This Coast to Coast route starts on the Atlantic Coast at Portreath, once an important harbour for the surrounding mines, and finishes at the picturesque harbour village of Devoran.

A number of important mine buildings have been conserved in the area and linked by trails that follow as closely as possible the original tramway and railway routes used to transport ore from mines to ports.

These sign-posted, largely off-road routes have been specially created for walkers, cyclists and horse riders. Refreshments and food are available at good pubs in Portreath, Scorrier (mid way) and Devoran.</div>

TrailNav is a custom designed series of maps of the Mineral Trails of Cornwall, all based on Google Maps.

This means all the features of Google maps can be accessed from the TrailNav App. Click on any of the markers for features specific to the trails. Alternatively click any Google marker for information about any business.

Also with TrailNav, because we use the Google Map system, you are able to use Streetview to get an interactive view of the routes that have been mapped by Streetview
